## The Why

> "I want to just go full-time working on GSD. I had no idea how I was going to do it, but my partner definitely was a little bit shocked when I was like, 'Yeah, I'm all in on this thing that I've built and thousands of people are using it worldwide right now.'" — TÂCHES

This is a meaningful amount of work to maintain. Sponsorship makes it easier to keep GSD evolving quickly—without turning it into enterprise theater.
