# Support The Project

If GSD is saving you time (or making Claude Code feel *actually reliable*), sponsorship and word-of-mouth are the highest-leverage ways to help.

## The Short Version

1. **Star the repo** so more developers find it.
2. **Sponsor the work** so ongoing maintenance is sustainable.
3. **Share a concrete win** (tweet, blog post, internal note) so others understand what it does.

## Why Sponsorship Matters
