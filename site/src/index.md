## Why developers like it

> *"If you know clearly what you want, this WILL build it for you. No bs."*

> *"I've done SpecKit, OpenSpec and Taskmaster — this has produced the best results for me."*

> *"By far the most powerful addition to my Claude Code. Nothing over-engineered. Literally just gets shit done."*

## Quick start

1. Run `npx get-shit-done-cc`
2. Open (or start) a Claude Code project
3. Run `/gsd:help`
4. Start with `/gsd:new-project` (or `/gsd:map-codebase` if you already have code)
