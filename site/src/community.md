# What The Community Is Saying

A few highlights from the broader developer community, plus a walkthrough video that explains the system end-to-end.

## A Community Walkthrough Video

The best “outside-in” explanation is this walkthrough video:

<div class="video">
  <div class="video-embed">
    <iframe
      width="560"
      height="315"
      src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SqmXS8q_2BM"
      title="GSD Explained"
      frameborder="0"
      allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
      allowfullscreen
    ></iframe>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p class="lede">In plain language: GSD is an orchestration layer that helps Claude Code go from idea → roadmap → atomic tasks → verified output.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Context rot is real.</strong> Long sessions drift; fresh subagents keep work focused.</li>
      <li><strong>Plans are executable prompts.</strong> Phases → subplans → tasks, each with verification criteria.</li>
      <li><strong>State stays persistent.</strong> Project + roadmap + state docs make restarts less painful.</li>
    </ul>

## Pull Quotes Developers Repeat

<div class="grid">
  <div class="card">
    <h3>“No Enterprise Theater”</h3>
    <p>GSD is designed for solo builders who want scaffolding without ceremonies.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card">
    <h3>“Fresh Context Per Task”</h3>
    <p>Atomic tasks run in clean subagent contexts to reduce drift across long projects.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card">
    <h3>“Verification Criteria Built In”</h3>
    <p>Plans include measurable checks, plus human validation prompts when needed.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## Quotes From Users

> “If you know clearly what you want, this WILL build it for you. No bs.”

> “I’ve done SpecKit, OpenSpec and Taskmaster — this has produced the best results for me.”

> “By far the most powerful addition to my Claude Code. Nothing over-engineered. Literally just gets shit done.”
